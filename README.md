# One Day, One Project: Machine Learning Challenges

Welcome to my "One Day, One Project" repository! The goal of this repository is to tackle one machine learning project each day. This journey will help me practice and enhance my skills in machine learning and data science.

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of daily machine learning projects. Each day, I will work on a new project, starting with the iris flower classification on Day 1. The projects will cover various classification, regression, clustering, and other machine learning tasks.

## Projects

| Day | Project Title                     | Description                                                                                                                                                    |

| 1   | Iris Flower Classification        | The Iris dataset by Fisher (1936) is a classic 150-instance tabular dataset with 4 features, used for classification of three iris plant classes.              |
| 2   | Titanic Survival Prediction       | [TBA]                          |
| 3   | [TBA]                   | [TBA]                          |
| ... | ...                               | ...                                                          |

Each project will have its own folder containing the necessary code, datasets, and a detailed explanation of the problem and solution.

## Installation

To run the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/one-day-one-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd one-day-one-project
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each project will have its own set of instructions. Navigate to the project's folder and follow the instructions in the project's README file.

For example, to run the Day 1 project:

1. Navigate to the Day 1 project directory:
    ```bash
    cd projects/day-1-iris-flower-classification
    ```

2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within that directory.
