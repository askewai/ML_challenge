# One Day, One Project: Machine Learning Challenges

Welcome to my "One Day, One Project" repository! The goal of this repository is to tackle one machine learning project each day. This journey will help me practice and enhance my skills in machine learning and data science.

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of daily machine learning projects. Each day, I will work on a new project, starting with the iris flower classification on Day 1. The projects will cover various classification, regression, clustering, and other machine learning tasks.

## Projects

| Day | Project Title                     | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Iris Flower Classification        | The Iris dataset by Fisher (1936) is a classic 150-instance tabular dataset with 4 features, used for classification of three iris plant classes.              |
| 2   | Titanic Survival Prediction       | The Titanic dataset by Frank & Thomas contains information about the survival status of Titanic passengers, with variables such as passenger class, age, gender, and ticket, which have been updated and corrected using primary sources like the Encyclopedia Titanica.                          |
| 3   | House Price Prediction                  | The real estate valuation dataset is a regression problem based on historical market data collected from Sindian District, New Taipei City, Taiwan. It consists of 414 instances and six features, including transaction date, house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, latitude, and longitude. The target variable represents house price per unit area in 10,000 New Taiwan Dollars per Ping (1 Ping = 3.3 mÂ²). The dataset contains no missing values and has been randomly split into a training set (2/3) and a testing set (1/3). It was used in a study published in *Applied Soft Computing* to build valuation models using a case-based reasoning approach.                          |
| 4 | Spam Email Detection                               | The SMS Spam Collection is a public dataset for mobile spam research, containing 5,574 labeled SMS messages. It includes 425 spam messages from Grumbletext, a UK spam-reporting forum, and 3,375 ham messages from the NUS SMS Corpus. Stored in a single text file, each line has a label ("ham" or "spam") and the message. The dataset, compiled with manual effort, is widely used for spam detection research.                                                          |
|  ...  |   ...                                             |    ...                                                 |

Projects will be grouped into basic and intermediate levels which contain google colab (Python) files.

## Installation

To run the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/one-day-one-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd one-day-one-project
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each project will have its own set of instructions. Navigate to the project's folder and follow the instructions in the project's README file.

For example, to run the Day 1 project:

1. Navigate to the Day 1 project directory:
    ```bash
    cd projects/day-1-iris-flower-classification
    ```

2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within that directory.
