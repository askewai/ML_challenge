## about
The Iris dataset, introduced by Fisher in 1936, is one of the most classic and earliest datasets used for evaluating classification methods in statistics and machine learning. This tabular dataset, rooted in biology, consists of 150 instances representing three classes of iris plants, with 50 instances per class. Each instance is characterized by four real-valued features, making it a simple yet foundational domain for classification tasks. One class is linearly separable from the other two, while the latter two are not linearly separable from each other. The dataset is widely recognized for its historical significance and remains a benchmark for testing classification algorithms. Notably, there are minor discrepancies in the dataset compared to Fisher's original article, with specific errors identified in the 35th and 38th samples. Despite these small inconsistencies, the dataset is complete, with no missing values, and continues to be a valuable resource for learning and research in data science.
